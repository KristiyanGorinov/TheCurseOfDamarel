# TheCurseOfDamarel
C# Console project /(adventure type game)

At the start you choose one of the main genders:
- Male
- Female

Then you pick your character. You are represented with all of their stats :
- Swordsman
- Archer
- Berserker
- Lumberjack
- Spearman

After that there is an random weapon box from witch you get your weapon.
There are 5 different rarities :
- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary 

Thirdly you choose you path. There are two options:
- Planes
- Forest
We think that the *Forest* is Easy mode and *Planes* is Hard mode.
After choosing your path you encounter 3 different enemies based on your choise:
- Planes : slime, fungi, earthgolem
- Forest : wolves, bears, gromp

After each fight you get a random buff on one of your main stats :
- HP : heal for 215 (if it is exceeding your starting amount it just fills it up completely)
- DMG : buff your dmg by 10%
- DEF : buff your def by 25%
- ATSP : buff your aysp by 33%

If you manage to win your 3 fights you will face off the Main boss of your chosen path :
- BAUBAU : *Forest*
- BLOBGLOB : *Planes*

After you defeat the final boss the game ends with ending credits.

Details for the game: 
- There is no difference between the gender!
- If you lose any of the fights the program ends.
- There are still upcoming patch notes and balance changes.
- Common : 40% | Uncommon : 17% | Rare : 20% | Epic : 13% | Legendary : 10%
- There is a secret rare buff that enhances all of your stats and it does not care about the starting HP amount ( *Note* - if you recieve HP heal after the rare buff your HP returns back to normal )
